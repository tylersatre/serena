# Usage

Serena can be used in various ways.
In this section, you will find general usage instructions as well as concrete instructions for selected integrations.

* For coding with Claude, we recommend using Serena through [Claude Code](#claude-code) or [Claude Desktop](#claude-desktop). You can also use Serena in most other [terminal-based clients](#other-terminal-based-clients).
* If you want a GUI experience outside an IDE, you can use one of the many [local GUIs](#local-guis-and-frameworks) that support MCP servers.
  You can also connect Serena to many web clients (including ChatGPT) using [mcpo](docs/serena_on_chatgpt.md).
* If you want to use Serena integrated in your IDE, see the section on [other MCP clients](#other-mcp-clients---cline-roo-code-cursor-windsurf-etc).
* You can use Serena as a library for building your own applications. We try to keep the public API stable, but you should still
  expect breaking changes and pin Serena to a fixed version if you use it as a dependency.
